    **AndersonDarling**

    The Anderson-Darling test is a statistical test of whether a given
    sample of data is drawn from a given probability distribution. When
    applied to testing if a normal distribution adequately describes a set of
    data, it is one of the most powerful statistical tools for detecting most
    departures from normality.

    For a normal distribution the Anderson-Darling statistic should take values
    close to 0.25.
