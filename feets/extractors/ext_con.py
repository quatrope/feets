    **Con**

    Index introduced for the selection of variable stars from the OGLE
    database (Wozniak 2000). To calculate Con, we count the number of three
    consecutive data points that are brighter or fainter than :math:`2\sigma`
    and normalize the number by :math:`Nâˆ’2`.

    For a normal distribution and by considering just one star, Con should
    take values close to 0.045:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> fs = feets.FeatureSpace(only=['Con'])
        >>> features, values = fs.extract(**lc_normal)
        >>> dict(zip(features, values))
        {'Con': 0.0476}
