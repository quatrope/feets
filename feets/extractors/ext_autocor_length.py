    **Autocor_length**

    The autocorrelation, also known as serial correlation, is the
    cross-correlation of a signal with itself. Informally, it is the similarity
    between observations as a function of the time lag between them. It is a
    mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns, such as the presence of
    a periodic signal obscured by noise, or identifying the missing fundamental
    frequency in a signal implied by its harmonic frequencies.

    For an observed series :math:`y_1, y_2,\dots,y_T`  with sample mean
    :math:`\bar{y}`, the sample lag :math:`-h` autocorrelation is given by:

    .. math::

       \rho_h = \frac{\sum_{t=h+1}^T (y_t - \bar{y})(y_{t-h}-\bar{y})}
                            {\sum_{t=1}^T (y_t - \bar{y})^2}

    Since the autocorrelation fuction of a light curve is given by a vector and
    we can only return one value as a feature, we define the length of the
    autocorrelation function where its value is smaller than  :math:`e^{-1}` .
