    This function executes a series of feature extractors on provided data
    and returns a dictionary of the selected features. It assumes that the
    given extractors are sorted in order of their dependencies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    extractors : list of Extractor
        The extractors to run. Must be sorted in order of dependencies.
    selected_features : list of str
        The features to return.
    required_data : list of str
        The data required by the extractors.
    kwargs
        The data to feed the extractors.

    Returns
    -------
    features : dict
        The extracted features.
        Example: {"feature1": 123, "feature2": 456}

    Raises
    ------
    DataRequiredError
        If some required data is missing.

    Notes
    -----
    The extractors are ran in parallel using Dask:
